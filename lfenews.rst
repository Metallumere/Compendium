Kanyra members made comments expressing their positive attitude towards humans. The cause of their actions is as of yet unknown.

**BREAKING - Over 120 important eNdymioN members on strike**

Apparently some eNdymioN members are protesting against the Life > LFE transfer.

Second hand reports claim that eNdymioN employees associated with TSUKI are missing, and the group on strike is not connected to the TSUKI project.
